## What is Research?

> "Research is what I am doing when I don't know what I am doing," Wernher von Braun

The defining characteristic of research is everything---from motivation to methods to evaluation to
goal---is tentative: in the middle of doing research, you don't know what will be the end result. As
a consequence, a researcher will suffer from:

- **Failure everyday**. You don't know what you're doing, so you'll fail almost always. To deal with
  the frustration from such failures, you should be mentally tough enough to tolerate such
  frustration. If successful, from time to time you will be able to understand or design small
  things, which accumulate to a paper and a thesis.

- **Changing plans**. You don't know what you're doing, so your goal will be changing as you make
  progress on your project. So any long-term plan is destined to be significantly revised. Thus you
  should think of the goal as a ever-moving target, the current version being just the best possible
  approximation of the actual end result. Your goal should be neither too concrete nor too abstract:
  if too concrete, it will not be resilient to the revision; if too abstract, it will not guide your
  research.


## How to prepare for a meeting?

- Before asking for a meeting, write down a short meeting agenda and share it.

- In the agenda, clearly state the purpose of meetings.  It can be, but not limited to: (1)
  reporting the progress, (2) asking questions/opinions, or (3) just chatting.

- Try to be direct, top-to-bottom, and conclusion-first.
    + e.g. not "A, so B, so C", but "C, because B, because A"

- If you have multiple things to discuss, enumerate them at the beginning of a meeting for better
  planning of the meetings.


## Communication

All communication (except for Mattermost chat in work hours) is **asynchronous**: the receiver is
not required to reply promptly. Mattermost chat in work hours is supposed to be synchronous: the
receiver is requested to reply promptly.

## First things to do

You should know how to use Git. If not, study [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/).

Study the following programming languages depending on your research interest:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), or
- [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) (by reading [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) Volume 1).
